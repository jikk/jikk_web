% Say that research work has been both theoretical and practical.
My main research interest is about protecting/hardening software systems against
malicious attempts from attackers or gaining more reliability against unintended
software bugs leveraging the latest research innovations. Recently, these
innovations are invented from both areas of static and dynamic program analyses
and I am interested in combining those two different research directions so that
can serve/complement one another making the technology more practical in serving
in many real world scenarios.

\subsection*{Background and Current Work}
% Paragraph 1: A brief paragraph sketching the overarching thematics and topic
% of your research, situating it disciplinarily.
%
In my research history, I extensively explored various aspects of Data Flow
Tracking (DFT) for its effectiveness in serving many different areas of research
as well as making it efficient so that it can more be adopted by users who are in
need to protect their systems.
%
To improve  performance of the technology, which incurs prohibitive amount
overhead especially when it is applied to binaries, I developed and utilized
number of static program analysis technologies so that we can make DFT suitable
in many real world scenarios.
%
For this, my interested research area includes instrumentation schemes
leveraging virtualization layer and static program analyses for many different
substrates which include compiler techniques for programming language
representations and binary analysis.

% Para 2: A summary of the dissertation research. This may replicate to some
% extent the paragraph on the dissertation in the cover letter but it must have
% more detail about the methods, the theoretical foundations, and most of all,
% the core arguments.  Here, give a chapter summary, approximately one sentence
% per chapter.

% Para 3: A brief description of the contribution of the dissertation research
% to your field or fields, and a summary of publications associated with the
% dissertation research, including a plan for the book, if you are in a book
% field.
