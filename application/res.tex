% Abstract that states about my research theme.  Say that research work has
% been both theoretical and practical.
My long-term research goal lies in {\it i)} building security systems that
would harden unknown software programs by making it immune to software failures
caused either by active exploitation of malicious attackers or unintended
discovery of developer bugs and {\it ii)} making these technologies efficient
and practical by addressing the issue of high overhead.
%
To achieve the goal, I leveraged number of recent research innovations designed
for different software system stacks. Specifically, I have been interested in
combining static and dynamic analysis to address the issue of high overhead.
%
My main research contributions have been concretized over past a few years as I
developed and improved well-known security system of data flow tracking~(DFT).
Although my research have focused on a specific security architecture, I
believe that the insights that I learned can benefit the area of system
security in general since DFT share many architectural characteristics with
other security architectures.
%
Besides DFT and the same family of security solutions, I am also interested in
other techniques related to software reliability which include
whitebox/blackbox fuzzing and building a system that defends against integer
error.

\subsection*{Data Flow Tracking(DFT) System Innovations}
% Paragraph 1: A brief paragraph sketching the overarching thematics and topic
% of your research, situating it disciplinary.
%
DFT has been my main research topic which I extensively explored various
aspects of the technology for its {\it effectiveness} in serving many different
topics of research as well as for its {\it efficiency} in making it more
adopted by production systems.
%
Typical DFT system is composed of three different operations {\it i)} {\it
tagging} input variables come in though any untrusted sources {\it ii)} {\it
propagating} tag values associated to the variables as the program executed
{\it iii)} {\it checking} for unintended usages of tagged variables. Our DFT
implementations injects these operations using VM-based instrumentation
framework, which is PIN Dynamic Binary Instrumentation~(DBI) framework, to
apply the technology to COTS binaries.
%
Besides implementing DFT system that correctly operates, I invented number of
novel optimizations and architectures that alleviates its excessive slowdown
which is inherent to DFT implementations for COTS binaries and security systems
of the same kind. And this is what I consider as the main contribution of my
research.

% libdft
\subsubsection*{\libdft: High performance fine-grained DFT system for COTS
software}

\libdft~\cite{libdft:2012vee} is our initial prototype implementation for DFT
that propagates tag values in byte granularity.
%
It supports generic API that enables users to customize and build tools up to
their own research/protection demands and implements process level
protection~(not system-wide) by injecting DFT logic for individual
taint-propagating instructions leveraging VM-based instrumentation framework.
%
Core to \libdft's performance improvement is in understanding the precise
definition of taint propagation semantics for {\it x86} instruction set as well
as the structural limitations of VM-based instrumentation layer. \libdft
addresses these issues by introducing optimal tracking codes customized for
different types of {\it x86} instructions. Two main considerations that we made
for the implementation are {\it i)} minimization of the cost required for
context switching between the original application and DFT analysis contexts
and {\it ii)} design and efficient management of shadow memory area.
%
Evaluation for the prototype shows $\sim$10$\times$ - $\sim$11$\times$ slowdown
over the native execution for a number of standard benchmark suites and this
was a significant performance improvement over previous DFT implementations by
the time we introduced the system.\jikk{more justification needed for this
statement}

% TFA (Taint Flow Algebra)
\subsubsection*{\TFA: A framework for principled optimizations for DFT}

Even with the highly crafted/customized tracking logics that we invented for
\libdft, its operation still remained sub-optimal for not being able to address
the fundamental limitations common to up-to-date DFT implementations. These are
about lacking in understandings for {\it i)} the global context of DFT
operations and {\it ii)} the semantics of DFT operations which is clearly
different from that of the original program execution.
%
\TFAFull~(\TFA)~\cite{tfa:2012ndss} is a special purpose Intermediate
Representation~(IR) that captures DFT logics extracted from the original {\it
x86} binary. With this representation, we apply number of traditional compiler
optimizations as well as DFT specific optimizations that we developed to
overcome aforementioned limitations.\jikk{Then, if in-line optimized DFT logics
back to the application not compromising any of security guarantees that our
baseline tool would provide.}
%
For this, we developed the framework composed of two sub-components.
The first one is the static analysis component run from dedicated
off-line analysis phase and prepares the optimized DFT logics specific to the
target applications. The second one is the dynamic runtime component that
enforces the optimized DFT operations back to the original program at runtime.
%
% may want to mention about 'feedback loop' connecting two components.
%
As a result, TFA could achieve \(\sim\)~2\(\times\) performance improvement
over  our baseline tool(\libdft) when it is evaluated against the same set of
standard benchmark suites without compromising the correctness~\footnote{In
        this context, by {\it correctness}, we aim to ensure the same level of
security guarantees that the baseline tool (\libdft) can provide.} of DFT
operations.

% ShadowReplica
\subsubsection*{\SR: A framework for parallelized execution of DFT}
%
Given that \TFA represents DFT logics extracted from the original program and
apply number of optimization approaches, \SR~\cite{sreplica:2013ccs} project
extends \TFA approach further to have more performance gain by running the
original program and the extracted DFT logics from two separate cores~(CPUs).
%
Of course, we are not the first one who are aligned toward the approach of
parallelized DFT analysis, but the most of previous proposals failed to achieve
expected performance improvement mainly due to the high communication overhead
connecting two different execution contexts. In most cases, the cost overwhelms
the parallelization benefit by causing to require excessive amount of resources
to make the system suitable for online deployment.
%
The main contribution of \SR project lies in addressing the issue of high
communication overhead and proposing a framework  to defend against any
software failures/exploitations at runtime. Different from previous proposals,
the system only requires a single additional analysis thread per an application
thread and the latter~(the thread executes optimized \TFA representation) runs
at the  same or faster speed than that of the former making synchronization
between two different contexts easier.
%
In \SR project, we again dedicate static analysis phase {\it i)} to have DFT
logic extracted from the target application binary and represent them in \TFA
\xspace{\it ii)} to minimize the volume and frequency of the communication
requirement.
%
Architectural consideration is required in designing the communication channel
which would easily become a performance bottleneck as it fails to schedule two
threads for their shared resources of L1/L2 CPU caches.
%
As a result, \SR framework could improve the overhead by $\sim$2$\times$,
$\sim$4$\times$ over \TFA and \libdft respectively when it is evaluated for the
same standard benchmark suites, achieving $\sim$2.75$\times$ slowdown over the
native execution.

As an interesting side effect of \SR, even though it takes up additional CPUs
to achieve better performance, the entire framework consumes the same or less
amount of CPU cycles than that of comparable in-lined DFT implementation~(in
this case \TFA) for the same analysis.
%
In this case, the benefit of having smaller instrumented code for event
collection~(when it is compared to the size of code of in-lined DFT analysis)
and its subsequent performance saving in the DBI's context management cost
outran the cost for establishing the communication channel and exchanging data
between two threads.

\subsection*{Research Agenda: Practical and accurate security architecture}
%
My main research interest lies in the area of the system security in general
that serves for the safety and reliability of software systems  and I could
have accumulated in depth insights and experiences about number of technologies
throughout my research career.
%
The followings are research topics that I am currently working on or keeping as
future topics which would help readers to have better understanding about my
long-term research agenda.
%

\subsubsection*{Mitigation of still too high overhead}
%
Even with the substantial amount of performance improvement that our research
could make for DFT systems, I should admit that we have not yet reached the
level where industry and research community would accept as adoptable to their
productions.
% - the following may be redundant.
%And there is a consensus around research communities that whatever benefit the
%security system would bring to its users, $5\%$ overhead is a threshold that
%would prevent the system being adapted as a production
%system.~\cite{ccs2013:invited_talk}
%
For DFT implementation and for most of similar security systems that in-line
monitoring logics to COTS binary, I could pin down two major overhead sources;
{\it i)} the cost for VM-based instrumentation and {\it ii)} the cost for
shadow memory management~(mainly occurs as it translates real address to it
counterpart shadow address).
%
Currently, I am working on projects of two different kinds to address these
issues. The first one resorts to additional hardware component and the second
one proposes a new hybrid instrumentation framework, a software only
solution that combines source-based and binary-only instrumentation.

{\bf Hardware-assisted \SR} Although \SR minimizes the size of the code
instrumented, the cost for original application execution along with
instrumented code for event collection still takes up the large portion of the
system's overall slowdown. Second to this, the cost for shadow memory
translation also incur non-negligible amount of computations.
%
Currently, we are working on a system the addresses these issues by introducing
another pipeline stage to the existing CPU architecture that records required
information and transfer it to another core. This would eventually replace the
in-lined event collector and connecting communication channel of \SR. Another
component we are implementing is a new instruction that would assist
real-to-shadow address translation. The important design criteria for this
project is to keep additional hardware component minimal and flexible so as it
can support other kinds of analysis with simple modification of software
component.

{\bf Hybrid instrumentation framework} In contrast to hardware-assisted \SR,
this is a software only approach that proposes a new instrumentation framework
that maximize the benefit of available~(partial) source access still supporting
COTS binaries.
%
This project combines two different instrumentation approaches into a single
framework. These are compiler-based~(LLVM) and VM-based~(PIN DBI)
instrumentation frameworks for source-based and binary-only instrumentation
respectively.
%
This hybrid approach introduces number of interesting research challenges that
include how to maintain a single execution unit integrating two very different
instrumentation approaches and support uniform API interface to support
different analyses.
%
Intuition behind this idea is that in most cases, we have partial accesses to
source base feasible for compiler-based instrumentation known to be several
times faster than VM-based instrumentation, and for the rest of execution
environments(which we do not have source access), we can use VM-based
instrumentation to maintain completeness.

\subsubsection*{Evaluation framework the soundness of DFT systems}
%
Although DFT has gained many attentions from research communities for its known
effectiveness, its {\it soundness} issue in terms of correct information flow
has not been explored thoroughly and the question about the existence and
frequency of incorrect flows~(false positives or false negatives) remains
unanswered. From this work, we introduce a new methodology to evaluate the
soundness of DFT systems and build a prototype framework implementation to
apply it.
%
The entire framework composed of two sub-components of {\it i)} taintedness
measurement component that evaluates different information flows and {\it ii)}
the input generation system that guides the measurement component leveraging
the approach of symbolic execution.\jikk{some more texts needed.}
%
In this project, we are planning to apply the methodology to evaluate number of
different DFT systems implemented for Android operating system.

% Some other research areas that I'm interested in.
\subsection*{Other research interests}
%
Besides DFT, I am interested in number of research topics also related to
safety and reliability of software systems in a broader sense.

\subsubsection*{A comparison study of DBI frameworks for security applications}
%
Oftentimes, security researchers choose one of the following three Dynamic
Binary Instrumentation~(DBI) frameworks -- PIN, DynamoRIO, and Valgrind -- as
their instrumentation medium when they need to in-line their security logic to
COTS binaries.
%
In this project, we carry out a comparison study that investigates various
aspects of these frameworks. As their behavioral and performance implications
significantly differ by each one's design philosophy and intended problem
domain, we propose number of criteria \jikk{Userability,
Effectiveness/capability, efficiency} to empirically evaluate these frameworks.
%
The goal of the project is to provide a guideline for users who want to find a
instrumentation framework that meets for their demand.

\subsubsection*{Runtime integer error detection}

The problem of detection and prevention of the integer errors for applications
written in C/C++ has long been around but the complete solution that would
clear the entire problem domain has not yet to come. 
%
To mechanically detect integer errors by instrumenting application source code
is not a difficult process but to figure out code writer's intention is a
tricky one as the compiler writers and application developers often take
advantage of these error intentionally to speed up their applications.
%
We integrate static and dynamic data flow tracking~(DFT) to a typical integer
error checker to address the issue of false positive~(FP) and false
negative~(FN) specifically. Using DFT, we can define relevant {\it source,
sink} pairs that would differentiate errors which would lead to exploitable
bugs from intended practices. One example for the pair is the place for
untrusted input(e.g., socket input, keyboard inputs) and a location for
arithmetic operation that triggers an integer error. The other example is a
pair of the location of integers errors and the security sensitive places such
as arguments for memory allocation functions~(e.g., {\tt malloc}, {\tt strcpy}) .
%
The approach aiming to build a system that can be use to defend against number
of different classes of integer errors at runtime and it is implemented as a
LLVM pass.

%What is the contribution from this line of work -- high level perspectives
\subsection*{Summary}

In the course of my research, I could establish in depth experience and insight
about DFT systems which is hot system security topics that shares its core
characteristics with many other security system architectures.
%
In effort to make the technology closer to the production deployment, I also
invented number of novel optimization techniques and frameworks that combine
static and dynamic analysis approaches.
%
Besides DFT, I am also interested in number of system security topics related
to hardening software systems and make those immune to exploitable defects or
unintended bugs. 
%
My future research agenda mainly focuses on developing and improving system
security architectures that would harden softwares for it safety and
reliability.
