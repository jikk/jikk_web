% Say that research work has been both theoretical and practical.
My main research interest is about protecting/hardening software systems
against malicious attempts from attackers or gaining more reliability against
unintended software bugs leveraging the latest research innovations. Recently,
these innovations are invented from both areas of static and dynamic program
analyses and my research interest lies in combining those two different
research directions so that can serve/complement one another making the
technology more practical in serving for many real world scenarios.

\subsection*{Background and Current Work}
% Paragraph 1: A brief paragraph sketching the overarching thematics and topic
% of your research, situating it disciplinary.
%
In my research history, I extensively explored various aspects of Data Flow
Tracking(DFT) for its effectiveness in serving many different areas of
research~\cite{libdft:2012vee, tfa:2012ndss, sreplica:2013ccs} as well as
making it efficient so that it can more be adopted by users who are in need to
protect their systems.

%
To improve performance of the technology, which incurs prohibitive amount
overhead especially when it is applied to binaries, I developed and utilized
number of static program analysis technologies so that we can make DFT suitable
in many real world scenarios.
% 
For this, my interested research area includes instrumentation schemes
leveraging virtualization layer and static program analyses for many different
substrates which include compiler techniques for programming language
representations and binary analysis.
%
Besides DFT, my research interest spans number of different topics which are
aligned to serve for software security and reliability.
%
\subsubsection*{DFT systems} 
\jikk{explain a bit of DFT system basics}

% libdft
With respect to the number of DFT related research outputs, we first
implemented \libdft~\cite{libdft:2012vee} which is highly optimized/efficient
DFT system runs for binary programs executed from {\tt x86} commodity hardware
system. \libdft provides generic API that helps anybody who want to customize
and build tools that serve for their own problem domains.\jikk{DTA is an
examplary implementation that we implemented with \libdft and we can definitely
have more of this kind}.
%
It is implemented via inlining DFT logic for individual {\tt x86} instructions
\jikk{which would deliver meta-information (\ie taintedness for DFT) from one
operand to another } levage tools from VM-hypervisor layer. For
instrumentation, we employed PIN dynamic binary instrumentation~(DBI)
framework. High efficiency of \libdft achieved by correctly understanding the
structural limitations of DBI-based inlining approaches. \libdft addresses this
issues by introducing optimal tracking codes customized for different types of
{\tt x86} instructions to avoids aforementioned issues. Examples of these
issues include i) the cost required for context switching between the target
application and DBI/analysis contexts ii) Design and efficient management of
shadow memory area and so on. 
%
Evaluation result showed $\sim$10$\times$ - $\sim$11$\times$ slowdown over the
native execution for a number of standard benchmark suites and this was a
significant performance improvement over previous DFT implementations by the
time we introduced the system.\jikk{more justification needed for this
statement}

% TFA (Taint Flow Algebra)
The immediate follow-up work is \TFAFull~(\TFA)~\cite{tfa:2012ndss} which
indicates a specially designed IR(intermediate representation) that represents
DFT tracking logics extracted from the original program binary.  Number of
compiler optimization techiniques as well as DFT specific ones are applied to
\TFA. Then the optimization result is inserted back to the original program. 
%
Even with the highly crafted/customized tracking logics that we invented for
\libdft, it is not yet close to the optimal and suffers from a good deal of
overhead which hinders DFT system's adoptation to production systems. We could
identify two fundamental the sources of in-optimality\jikk{?} inherent to all
previous DFT implementations including ours. These are about lacking in
understandings about {\it i)} global context of DFT tracking {\it ii)} DFT
semantics which is clearly different from that of the original execution
semantics.
%
To address these issues, we developed the system that is composed of two
different components. The one is for the static analysis to prepare the
optimized tracking logics from dedicated offline/analysis pahse and the other
is for dynamic runtime that enforces optimized DFT logics to the original
program \jikk{that we want to analyze or protect} at runtime.
%
As a result, TFA could achieve \(\sim\)~2\(\times\) performance improvement
over  our baseline tool(\libdft) whenit is evaluated against the same set of
standard benchmark suites without compromising the correctness~\footnote{In
        this context, by {\it correctness}, we want to ensure the same level of
security guarantees that the baseline tool \libdft can provide.} of DFT
operations.

% ShadowReplica 
Given that \TFA decouples/separates DFT logics from the original program
execution logics for optimization, \SR project extends this approach a step
further to gain more performance improvement by parallelizing two different
contexts utilizing redudant cores(CPUs) common in these days computer system
architectures. Of course, we are not the first one were who aligned toward the
direction of parallelized analysis, but the many of provious approaches failed
to achieve expected performance gains mostly because of high communcation
overhead. Oftentimes, the amount of communcation masked the parallelization
benefit makes the approach not suitable for runtime detection of malicious
activities. This subsequently results in resource over-usage.
%
The core contribution of \SR lies in explicitly addressing the issues of high
communcation cost.

The communication channel that connects two different context incurs
prohibitive amount of overhead up to the level where it overtakes the
parallelization benefits. Our major contribution lies in mitigating
communication overhead again combining the static and dynamic analysis to
address the issue.
%
\SR system again improves the overhead about $\sim$2$\times$, $\sim$4$\times$
over our previous DFT implementations of \TFA and \libdft respectively,
achieving $\sim$2.75$\times$ slowdown over the native execution. 
%What is the contribution from this line of work -- high level perspectives

\begin{itemize}
    \item Experience with popular research topics of DFT whose core
    architectural specifics are shared with inlining system of the same
    kind. 
    \item Perfect/ideal alignment of static and dynamic analysis which
    serves/complements one another.
