\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Master Student Research Assistant, Columbia University}, Sep 2007 - May 2008. \\
%
  {\bf Application Community}, (Jan 2007 - Aug 2009): Designed and implemented
  security architecture that segments and distributes defense and protection
  responsibility across the large number of hosts connected via the Internet
  leveraing software mono-cultures. The insight behind this approach to
  alleviates the issue of high overhead which is unavoidable to the most of
  existing dyanamic security solutions while maintaining the rate of the
  detection statastical threshold that we set.
% TODO: some closing setence should follow.

\vspace{0.1cm}
\item  {\bf Research Assistant, Columbia University}, June 2007 - Current. \\
%
%   {\bf MINESTRONE: IDENTIFYING AND CONTAINING SOFTWARE VULNERABILITIES} (
%   IARPA project, 08/2010 - 07/2014): MINESTRONE is a novel architecture that integrates
%   static analysis, dynamic confinement, and code diversification techniques to
%   enable the identification, mitigation and containment of a large class of
%   software vulnerabilities. Our techniques will protect new software, as well as
%   already deployed (legacy) software by transparently inserting extensive
%   security instrumentation. \\
%   %
%   {\bf SPARCHS: Symbiotic, Polymorphic, Autotomic, Resilient, Clean-slate, Host
%     Security} (DARPA CRASH project, 10/2010 - 09/2014): The SPARCHS project is
%   considering a new computer systems design methodology that considers security
%   as a first-order design requirement at all levels, starting from hardware, in
%   addition to the usual design requirements such as programmability, usability,
%   speed, and power/energy efficiency.
%   
  {\bf Taint Flow Algebra}, (Jan 2010 - Dec 2011): From a network designer's
  perspective a shared memory router is ideal in that the packets are stored in
  a central location and the memory bandwidth and space is shared across packets
  from all ports. This sharing helps in conserving memory space and results in
  low cost and low power routers. However, it is a widely held myth that such
  shared memory routers are not scalable to higher speeds due to limitations
  imposed on the speed of a single memory. I worked on the first demonstration
  and proof to show how to build and scale the capacity of shared memory routers
  using distributed memories. \\
%
  {\bf ShadowReplica}, (Jan 2012 - June 2013): From a network designer's
  perspective a shared memory router is ideal in that the packets are stored in
  a central location and the memory bandwidth and space is shared across packets
  from all ports. This sharing helps in conserving memory space and results in
