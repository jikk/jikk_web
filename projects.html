          <h3><a href="http://nsl.cs.columbia.edu/projects/minestrone/">
          MINESTRONE: Identifying and containing software
          vulnerabilities</a></h3>
          <p>MINESTRONE is a novel architecture that integrates static analysis,
          dynamic confinement, and code diversification techniques to enable the
          identification, mitigation and containment of a large class of
          software vulnerabilities. Our techniques will protect new software, as
          well as already deployed (legacy) software by transparently inserting
          extensive security instrumentation.</p>
          
          <h3><a href="https://sparchs.cs.columbia.edu/sparchs/">SPARCHS:
          Symbiotic, Polymorphic, Autotomic, Resilient, Clean-slate, Host
          Security</a></h3>
          <p>The SPARCHS project is considering a new computer systems design
          methodology that considers security as a first-order design
          requirement at all levels, starting from hardware, in addition to the
          usual design requirements such as programmability, usability, speed,
          and power/energy efficiency.</p>
        <h2>Research Project</h2>
        <h3><a id="#dbi_study"> A comparison study of Dynamic Binary Instrumentation(DBI)
          frameworks</a></h3>
          <p>
          This project is about comparing different aspects of various
          DBI framework which includes <a href="">PIN</a>, <a href="">DynamoRIO</a>,
          and <a href="">Valgrind</a>. These three frameworks are the most
          representative frameworks vibrantly used from various areas to
          protect and analyze software programs.

          As their behavioral and performance implications significantly differ
          according to each one's design choices and design philosophy, we want
          to empirically evaluate them using criteria listed below.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Userability: </b> the framework's learning curve, the
          framework's user-friendliness of API, Supports from developer community</li>
            <li><b>Effectiveness/Capability: </b> framework's ability to
          instrument and manipulate the target software provided without compromising the
          execution transparency.</li>
            <li><b>Efficiency: </b>  performance overhead of the framework when it
          instruments the target software.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3><a id="#taint_measure">Measurement of effectiveness and
          correctness of dynamic taint tracking</a></h3>

          <p>Dynamic Taint Analysis(DTA) gained popularity and exists many
          implementation and deployed for many research and production
          purposes. Albeit its known effectiveness and usefulness for various
          research areas such as malware analysis, runtime attack detection,
          detection of information leakages and so on, its correctness in terms
          of false positives(FPs) or false nagatives(FNs) hasn't been
          studied actively/thoroughly.

          From this project, we want to have a look at
