          MINESTRONE: Identifying and containing software
          vulnerabilities</a></h3>

          <p>MINESTRONE is a novel architecture that integrates static analysis,
          dynamic confinement, and code diversification techniques to enable the
          identification, mitigation and containment of a large class of
          software vulnerabilities. Our techniques will protect new software, as
          well as already deployed (legacy) software by transparently inserting
          extensive security instrumentation.</p>
          
          <h3><a href="https://sparchs.cs.columbia.edu/sparchs/">SPARCHS:
          Symbiotic, Polymorphic, Autonomic, Resilient, Clean-slate, Host
          Security</a></h3>
          
          <p>The SPARCHS project is considering a new computer systems design
          methodology that considers security as a first-order design
          requirement at all levels, starting from hardware, in addition to the
          usual design requirements such as programmability, usability, speed,
          and power/energy efficiency.</p>

          <h2>Research Project</h2>

          <h3><a id="#dbi_study">A comparison study of Dynamic Binary
          Instrumentation(DBI) frameworks</a></h3>
          
          <p>
          This project is about comparing different aspects of various
          DBI framework which includes <a href="">PIN</a>, <a href="">DynamoRIO</a>,
          and <a href="">Valgrind</a>. These three frameworks are the most
          representative frameworks vibrantly used from various areas to
          protect and analyze software programs.

          As their behavioral and performance implications significantly differ
          according to each one's design choices and design philosophy, we want
          to empirically evaluate them using criteria listed below.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><b>Userability: </b> the framework's learning curve, the
          framework's user-friendliness of API, Supports from developer
          community</li>
            <li><b>Effectiveness/Capability: </b> framework's ability to
          instrument and manipulate the target software provided without
          compromising the execution transparency.</li>
            <li><b>Efficiency: </b> performance overhead of the framework when
          it instruments the target software.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a id="#taint_measure">Measurement of effectiveness and correctness
          of dynamic taint tracking</a></h3>

          <p>Dynamic Taint Analysis(DTA) gained more and more from research
          communities. Albeit its known effectiveness and usefulness for
          various research areas such as malware analysis, runtime attack
          detection, detection of information leakages and so on, its
          correctness in terms of false positives(FPs) or false negatives(FNs)
          hasn't been studied with cares.

          From this project, we want to tackle the issue of correct and sound
          tainting with known DTA implementations. Fo this we implemented
          evaluation framework for correct and sound tainting along with input
          generation system based on symbolic block fuzzing approaches.  </p>

          <h3><a id="#hybrid_instr"></a>Dynamic instrumentation framework for
          sources and binaries</h3>
        
          <p>One way of implementing inline security monitor is by instrumenting
          monitoring log[ics along with target application's
          execution. Traditionally, we can employ two different instrumentation
          approaches based on the availability of target application's source
          code. Typically approaches of source-to-source transformation or
          compilers can be used, with accesses to the source whereas
          virtualization frameworks were used when we only have accesses to
          binaries. Pros and cons of each approach are apparent. While compiler
          based approach can provides better performance numbers optimizing
          monitoring logics along with the target application as it produce
          binaries, it has problem supporting libraries that comes without
          sources. In contrast, binary-only approach can trivial support full
          coverages leveraging VM layer, it comes with more overheads most of
          the times. However situations are not black and white, we neither do
          have full source access covering the entire execution environment nor
          have no source access any part of it. This opens up another research
          opportunity filling the gap by implement hybrid instrumentation that
          meets the full coverage requirement maximizing the benefit of the
          (even partial) source access.</p>


        <h3><a id="#number_handling">Runtime integer error detection</a> </h3>

        <p>Detection/prevention of integer error from applications written in
        C/C++ is a problem for a long time but none could come up with complete
        solution for this problem yet. Identification of integer error itself
        instrumenting user application is relatively straightforward. However,
        what it makes complicated is that the compiler writer as well as
        application sometimes uses these errors in their code intentionally to
        speed up their application or some other purposes. The real challenges
        lies in differentiating real errors from these intended practices.

        In this project, we integrate static and dynamic information flow
        tracking(IFT) to integer error detection system to address this
        issue. Using IFT, we define relevant source, sink pairs that specifies
        integer errors which lead to serious bugs that the attackers can
        leverage to exploit. One type of these pairs can be values come through
        untrusted input(e.g., socket input, keyboard inputs) and flow into
        arithmetic operations that triggers integer errors and the other type
        can be pairs of the location of integers errors into security sensitive
        places such as arguments for memory allocation functions.

        The followings are the class of integer errors that we are aiming to
        catch.

        <ul>
          <li>Integer overflow/underflow (CWE-190, CWE-191)</li>
          <li>Unexpected Sign Extension (CWE-194)</li>
          <li>Signed / Unsigned Conversion Error (CWE-195, CWE-196)</li>
          <li>Numerical Truncation Error (CWE-197)</li>
          <li>Divide by Zero (CWE-194)</li>
        </ul>

        The approach aiming to build a system that can provide defend capability
        against integer errors at runtime and it is implemented as a number of
        LLVM pass using application source code.
