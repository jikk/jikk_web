          MINESTRONE: Identifying and containing software
          vulnerabilities</a></h3>

          <p>MINESTRONE is a novel architecture that integrates static analysis,
          dynamic confinement, and code diversification techniques to enable the
          identification, mitigation and containment of a large class of
          software vulnerabilities. Our techniques will protect new software, as
          well as already deployed (legacy) software by transparently inserting
          extensive security instrumentation.</p>
          
          <h3><a href="https://sparchs.cs.columbia.edu/sparchs/">SPARCHS:
          Symbiotic, Polymorphic, Autonomic, Resilient, Clean-slate, Host
          Security</a></h3>
          
          <p>The SPARCHS project is considering a new computer systems design
          methodology that considers security as a first-order design
          requirement at all levels, starting from hardware, in addition to the
          usual design requirements such as programmability, usability, speed,
          and power/energy efficiency.</p>

          <h2>Research Project</h2>

          <h3><a id="#dbi_study">A comparison study of Dynamic Binary
          Instrumentation(DBI) frameworks</a></h3>
          
          <p> In this project, we perform comparison study that investigates
          various aspects of three different Dynamic Binary Instrumentation(DBI)
          frameworks. Oftentimes, one of these becomes system security
          researcher's choice for instrumentation framework to inline
          monitoring logic against unknown binaries. Currently, target
          frameworks for our study include <a
           href="http://www.pintool.org">PIN</a>, <a
           href="http://dynamorio.org/">DynamoRIO</a>, and <a
           href="http://valgrind.org/">Valgrind</a>. These three frameworks are
          the most representative DBI frameworks actively maintained by research
          communities.

          As their behavioral and performance implications significantly differ
          by each one's design philosophy and intended problem domain, we want
          to empirically evaluate them using criteria listed below.  </p>

          <ul>
            <li><b>Userability: </b> the framework's learning curve, the
          framework's user-friendliness of API, Supports from developer
          community</li>
            <li><b>Effectiveness/Capability: </b> framework's ability to
          instrument and manipulate the target software provided without
          compromising the execution transparency.</li>
            <li><b>Efficiency: </b> performance overhead of the framework when
          it instruments the target software.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a id="#taint_measure">Measurement of effectiveness and correctness
          of dynamic taint tracking</a></h3>

          <p>For past a few years, the technology of Dynamic Taint Analysis(DTA)
          has gained many attentions from research communities with its
          applications that span various research areas such as malware
          analysis, runtime attack detection, detection of information leakages
          and performance tuning. Albeit its known effectiveness, its
          correctness in terms of false positives(FPs) or false negatives(FNs)
          hasn't been studied with cares.

          <p>

          <br>
          </p>
        
          From this project, we want to tackle the issue of correct and sound
          tainting with existing DTA implementations. Fo this, we implemented
          taintedness measurement framework along with input generation system
          that extend symbolic blackbox fuzzing approach.</p>

          <h3><a id="#hybrid_instr"></a>Dynamic instrumentation framework for
          sources and binaries</h3>
        
          <p>We can implement inline security monitor by instrumenting
          monitoring logics along with target application's
          execution. Traditionally, we can employ two different instrumentation
          approaches based on the availability of the application's source
          code. The approaches of source-to-source transformation or compilers
          can be used for the case where we have accesses to the source, while
          we use virtualization frameworks when we only see binary executables
          with no source access.

          Pros and cons of each approach are apparent. While the source based
          approach can provides better performance output optimizing monitoring
          logics along with the target application as it produce a single binary
          combining two different context, it has problem supporting libraries
          that comes without sources. As one can easily expect, it is common to
          have unknown binaries in its execution environments such as <i>glibc</i>
          library. 

          In contrast, binary-only approach can trivial meet the goal of full
          coverages leveraging hypervisor layer with higher overhead switching
          back and forth two different contexts for the original execution and
          monitoring logic. 

          However, for most of situations being neither black nor white(neither
          no source access nor allowance for the entire source base), it calls
          for development of new instrumentation framework that achieve the full
          coverage requirement maximizing the benefit of the allowed source
          access.
 
          In this project, we <a href="http://dynamorio.org/">DynamoRIO</a>
          plays a role of program loader which differentiates binaries prepared
          with LLVM-pass which runs for source code to instrument monitoring
          logics from the rest binaries which requires DynamoRIO's
          instrumentation to monitoring logic for binaries.
         </p>


        <h3><a id="#number_handling">Runtime integer error detection</a> </h3>

        <p>The problem of detection/prevention for integer error for
        applications written in C/C++ has long been around but none could come
        up with complete solution to clear the entire problem domain
        yet. Mechanical detection of integer error instrumenting application
        source code can be regarded as a straightforward process. However, what
        it makes complicated is to figure out code writer's intention as the
        compiler writers as well as application developers takes advantage of
        these errors in their code to speed up their applications. The real
        challenges lies in differentiating real errors from these intended
        practices.

        In this project, we integrate static and dynamic data flow tracking(DFT)
        to <a href="">integer error detection system</a> to address this issue
        of false positive(FP) and false negative(FN) specifically. Using DFT, we
        define relevant (source, sink) pairs that would differentiate integer
        errors which lead to serious bugs that the attackers can leverage to
        exploit. One example of these pairs can be values come through untrusted
        input(e.g., socket input, keyboard inputs) and flow into arithmetic
        operations that triggers integer errors. The other example can be pairs
        of the location of integers errors flows into security sensitive places
        such as arguments for memory allocation functions.

        The followings are the class of integer errors that we are aiming to
        catch.

        <ul>
          <li>Integer overflow/underflow (CWE-190, CWE-191)</li>
          <li>Unexpected Sign Extension (CWE-194)</li>
          <li>Signed / Unsigned Conversion Error (CWE-195, CWE-196)</li>
          <li>Numerical Truncation Error (CWE-197)</li>
          <li>Divide by Zero (CWE-194)</li>
        </ul>

        The approach aiming to build a system that can provide defend capability
        against integer errors at runtime and it is implemented as a number of
        LLVM pass using application source code.
