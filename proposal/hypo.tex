\section{Research Assumptions} \label{sec:hypo} 

\subsection{\sreplica Generalization}
\label{ssec:general}

Even though our previous work mostly focuses on a specific instance of inline
monitor (\ie DFT), we strongly believe that the approach can easily be
generalized to support analyses of other kind with minimal porting effort.
Table~\ref{tab:analyses} introduces a list of well-known inline
monitors~\cite{cab:oopsala2009} that either protect or profile application
processes at runtime categorized by their structural features. The leftmost
column of {\it Shadow Memory} denotes whether the monitor requires shadow
memory area to keep track of memory updates from the application context. The
next column of {\it data dependency} denotes sequential dependency among
operations -- an operation of monitoring logic depends on the result from one
or more of previous operation(s). This property tells us whether we can
parallelize the analysis performed by the monitor for further performance
improvement. The column for {\it Check Operation} denotes whether the monitor
is entitled to check for a specific set of violations. For instance, dynamic
taint analysis (DTA)~\cite{taintcheck:ndss2005} tools check every {\tt RET}
instruction to see whether a tainted value is used to deviate control transfer.
In contrast, {\it cache simulation} does not have such requirement.

\end{table}

Our goal here is to extend \sreplica approach to support most of monitors
presented from Table~\ref{tab:analyses}. While the eventual output would be a
new framework equipped with supporting API that allow users to write tools that
would serve for their needs. However, due to time and resource constraint, we
will begin building a proof-of-concept implementation to support two
representative inline monitors of control flow integrity (CFI)~\cite{cfi} and
memory integrity tool~\cite{memcheck, drmemory:cgo2011}.

\subsubsection{Control Flow Integrity (CFI)} 

CFI, similarly to DTA, aims to prevent attackers from compromising applications
by hijacking their control flow. Programs normally follow programmer-intended
execution paths. CFI enforces program flow to follow one of these predetermined
paths. Determining a complete CFG of a program is a challenging task by itself,
but assuming such a CFG is available, CFI operates as follows.  Run-time checks
are injected in the application to ensure that control flow remains within the
CFG. These checks are placed before every indirect control flow transfer in the
application and check that the destination is one of the intended ones.
Specifically, all possible destinations of a particular control flow instruction
are assigned the same identifier (ID), which is validated before transferring
control. While this can be overly permissive, because multiple instructions may
have the same target thus assigning the same ID to a super-set of destinations,
this approach allows fast checks. 

Control flow tracking is already a core component of the current prototype of
\sreplica that replicates the execution trace observed from the original
application thread at BBL level granularity. This is to locate that \tfa
summary from the analysis thread and to perform the corresponding DFT
operation.
%
While it is too expensive to log and transfer the identifier for all BBLs
executed, \sreplica takes advantage of th CFG gathered from the profiling stage
to minimize the number of BBL identifiers (BBID) to be transferred.

Typical instruction set architectures (ISAs) including {\tt x86} systems have
three different types of control transfers illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:cfg0}: (a) direct jumps, (b) direct branches, and (c) indirect
jumps. For direct jumps, BBIDs for successor BBLs can be excluded from logging,
since there is only a single, fixed exit. For example, the transitions from
BBL0 to BBL1, and then to BBL2 in Figure~\ref{fig:cfg0} can be excluded. Direct
branches can have two outcomes.  They are either taken, or fall through where
execution continues at the next instruction. We exploit this property to only
enqueue a BBID, when the least frequent outcome, according to our dynamic
profiling, occurs. For instance, when BBL3 follows BBL2 in
Figure~\ref{fig:cfg0}. We use the absence of BBL3â€™s id to signify that BBL4
followed as expected. Note that if a BBL has two predecessors and it is the
most frequent path for only one of them, we log its BBID. Last, for indirect
jumps we always record the BBID following them, since they are hard to predict.
Fortunately, the number of such jumps are less compared with direct transfers.
%
Applying our approach on the CFG of Figure~\ref{fig:cfg0}, we would only need
to enqueue the id of BBL3 once. When applied to real applications, it could
save $70 \sim 80 \%$ of BBIDs from being logged.

It is a data representation issue that becomes the main challenge as we use
\sreplica's control flow replication to implement CFI. \sreplica differentiates
BBID from effective address (EA) by assigning different address range.
The aforementioned control flow optimization exploits this representation to
discern the direct branch choice. 
%
When an EA entry (and not BBID) is encountered it is an indicator that the edge with
the larger execution count was selected.  However, in order to implement CFI,
we need a new data representation since EAs can no longer substitute BBIDs and
naively logging all BBIDs would incur too high overhead.

\begin{figure}[tb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.64\linewidth]{figs/cfg0.eps}
    \caption{Example control flow graph. Nodes represent basic blocks and edges
    are control transfers. During dynamic profiling, we count how many times
    each edge is followed (edge labels). \label{fig:cfg0}}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Memory Integrity Tool (Memcheck)}

Memory integrity tools~\cite{memcheck, drmemory:cgo2011, asan} are designed to
assist developers by reporting (a) memory leakage errors by instrumenting known
memory allocator and deallocator routines to check whether a program terminates
before freeing any allocated memory chunks and (b) usage of an uninitialized
variable by tracking its propagations according to the rules specified in
Table~\ref{tab:memcheck_tracking}. The tool reports the usage of such
uninitialized variables at any point of the program execution.
%
DFT shares much of its architectural characteristics with memory integrity
tools since they utilize shadow memory to track the status of real memory space
while updates are made to the shadow memory by their tracking logic.

Table~\ref{tab:memcheck_tracking} introduces interpretation summary for memory
integrity tool which are different from DFT's interpretation (
Table~\ref{tab:dft_tracking}). One peculiarity that we want examine is that the
checking operation (for the usage uninitialized variables) is far more frequent
in this case, as it is verified before every memory reference.

\begin{table}[h]
        \centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
{\bf Instruction} & {\bf Tag propagation rule} \\ \hline \hline
{\tt \specialcell{int* p $\leftarrow$ malloc() \\ (allocation)}} & 
    {\tt t(p) $=$ UNDEF}\\ \hline
    {\tt op1  $\leftarrow$  0x1234} & {\tt t(op1) = DEF}     \\ \hline
    {\tt ALU-OP OP1  $\leftarrow$  OP2} & {\tt t(op1) = t(op1 ALU-OP op2)}     \\ \hline
    {\tt if op1 == then goto L} & {\tt Complain if t(op1) == UNDEF} \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{presents an interpretation of DFT semantics for pseudo instruction set
architecture.}
\label{tab:memcheck_tracking}
\end{table}

To extend \sreplica to support the tool of this kind of functionalities, we
have to make changes to its components that include (a) the binary analyzer
that translates {\tt x86} instructions into intermediate representation (\tfa),
(b) the analysis component that perform optimizations against the
representation.  Even though changes are not fundamental to \sreplica's core
architecture, we still need to clarify how system behaviors would change in
respond to the modifications we make. 

\subsection{Instrumentation Infrastructure Study}
\label{ssec:inst_infra}

As we discussed in Section~\ref{ssec:prev_eval}, it is the cost to
instrument the application thread to inline event collector that accounts for
the largest portion of the slowdown. In this section, we discuss 
alternatives of this substrate to improve the overall response time. Firstly,
we compare three different DBI frameworks including PIN DBI (our choice for
\sreplica) and then move on to cover different approaches based on
software~\cite{brewriting:usenix2003, DTrace} and
hardware~\cite{raksha:isca2007, lba:isca2008} assisted instrumentation. 

\subsubsection{DBI Comparison Study} 
\label{ssec:dbi_study}

Dynamic binary instrumentation (DBI) frameworks enable the development of
program analysis tools on unknown binaries by facilitating automated low-level
instrumentation. This technology takes advantage of the process-level
virtualization populating the code cache entries that combines the original codes
with users-authored analysis logics. This technique has become an essential
building block in developing tools that enhance the security and reliability
of software systems.  Representative frameworks of this kind are
PIN~\cite{pin:pldi2005}, Valgrind~\cite{valgrind}, and
DynamoRIO~\cite{dynamorio}.
%
Placed in the same layer between a running application and the underlying operating
system, each framework comes with different capabilities and performance
implications as each frameworkâ€™s design principles differs based on their intended
application domain. However, developers who want to leverage the technology
were rarely informed on how to choose a right framework that would serve
best to their purpose.
%
In this work, we compare three of aforementioned frameworks by carefully examining
three different aspects: efficiency, capability, and usability. The purpose of our
work is to provide a proper guideline to developers who want to develop
security analysis tools using this technology.

\subsubsection{Other Software Instrumentation Approaches}
\label{ssec:sw_inst}

Process-wide virtualization (\ie DBI) provides flexibility in instrumentation
process, but it cost users to pay high overhead in the course of translating
the binary, interleaving with analysis logic, and storing those into the code-cache
for future re-use. With this in mind, we want to explore feasible
software alternatives (but not based on virtualization technologies)
that can replace the layer with less overhead. The solution that we are actively
looking into are solutions based on {\it binary re-writing}~\cite{cfi,
brewriting:usenix2003} and we also plan to extend light-weighted system
tracing/monitoring frameworks similar to {\it DTrace}~\cite{DTrace} technology.

\subsubsection{Hardware Assisted Instrumentation} 
\label{ssec:hw_inst}

We are also considering to hardware based instrumentation to enhance
\sreplica's execution model. Chen \etal already proposed log based architecture
(LBA)~\cite{lba:isca2008}, a framework for decoupled analysis having hardware
level support, but its initial prototype failed to address the issue of the
excessive information collected from the application and transferred using the
shared cache connecting the two different cores. The overhead issue is later
resolved by the software side optimization. 
%
Our insight is that we can use \sreplica's approach to handle excessive amount
of communication volume and frequency to tackle the issue. Furthermore, our
optimal data representation of effective addresses (EAs) and control transfer
trace (BBID), needed to replicate inline monitors, would reduce the size of
required hardware component.
%
The main design and implementation challenges are (a) reducing the space
requirement for additional hardware component and (b) providing a flexible
support of different monitoring logics without requiring hardware logic update.

\begin{figure}[tb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.90\linewidth]{figs/model0.eps}

    \caption{Presents three different models to instrument inline monitors. From
    left to right (a) inlining model, (b) a producer -  consumer
    model, and (c) one producer - multiple consumers model.\label{fig:model0}}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Overhead Modeling Framework}

Inline monitors that we discussed from Section~\ref{ssec:inline} may have
different performance implications that would make them become slower when
parallelized than when the monitoring logic is in-lined into an original
process. We may find some other execution model what would work better for a
monitor. For instance, when the monitoring logic is too heavy-weight, it might
be better to distribute the workload over multiple worker threads
using a arbitrator thread. Formalizing the idea, we consider three different
models presented in Figure~\ref{fig:model0} to categorize inline monitors.

\begin{itemize}

    \item{{\bf Inlining model:} This inline monitor exhibits the best response time
            when the monitoring logic is interleaved with the application
    thread. Simple monitors such as call graph profiler falls into this
    category.}

    \item{{\bf $1-1$ model:} This inline monitor exhibits the best response time when
            every application thread  is assigned a corresponding analysis thread. This
    model is same as the produce-consumer design pattern. \sreplica implements this
    model to parallelize DFT analysis.}

    \item{{\bf $1-n$ model:} This inline monitor exhibits the best response time when
            more than one analysis threads are assigned to each application
    thread. This model requires a dedicated dispatcher thread for scheduling. To
    be suitable for this model, analysis needs to be heavy-weight and have
    weak data dependency. Cache simulation falls into this category.}

\end{itemize}

%
Given three aforementioned execution models, we want to establish an analytic
framework that would take one of in-lined model as an input and determine the
model that would lead to the best response time. Once we establish the
framework, we expect to have an ability to predict performance changes in
response to changes we make to \sreplica to fulfill hypotheses we discussed
from Section~\ref{ssec:general} and Section~\ref{ssec:inst_infra} 

Ha \etal\cite{cab:oopsala2009} proposed a model simpler than ours by taking
only two of execution models namely {\it Inlining model}
(Figure~\ref{fig:model0} (a)), and {\it $1-1$ model} (Figure~\ref{fig:model0}
(b)) into consideration. By not having a model for Figure~\ref{fig:model0} (c),
their model cannot cover cases where we have too expensive monitoring logic or
the cost for event collector and its instrumentation becomes very thin.
Furthermore, their purpose of having the model is different from ours. In our
case, the dynamic profiler will be used to capture performance characteristics
of target applications and monitors to be analyzed. Based on the profiling result,
we expect the framework to better categorize inline monitors based on
response time.

As we noted in the previous sections, we attempt to change the performance
characteristics of \sreplica and examine the instrumentation layer for better
performance. The modeling framework would be a meaningful contribution, if we
can confirm the benefits and disadvantages of these choices ahead of time.
