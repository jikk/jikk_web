A thesis proposal should contain (and maybe even be structured as):

- a description of the problem in enough detail to clearly state the thesis
  proposition (next item)

- a proper, concise thesis proposition; this is not an abstract statement like
  "we're going to investigate the malicious insider problem", but something
along the lines of "our hypothesis is that the use of XYZ technology in
environment Z under constraints Q can identify insider attackers with
probability Z" --- obviously, the fewer qualifiers the better, but you also
need to be accurate; since this is a thesis proposal, we will cut you some
slack -- but it's in *your* best interest to think hard about this, since it is
the anchor point of your whole thesis (and the next few years' worth of work
for you); quantifiable metrics are ideal elements of a hypothesis

- a description of the related work, how it does not solve the problem, and how
  your hypothesis has not been tested before
    - preferably using the metrics that were previously mentioned/defined (and
      justified)

- preliminary results (if any) that indicate that you have reason to believe
  that the hypothesis might be true

- additional experiments that you will run (or, more generally, work you will
  do) to prove that the hypothesis holds

- what you'll need to build (in terms of systems or resources/data/access) to
  run said experiments (and what you've already built)

- what happens if you can't run some of these experiments, or if they give you
  "bad" results --- what's your failover?

- what are the expected contributions, keeping in mind that each major
  contribution must demonstrate novelty, non-triviality, practicality, and
usefulness (so, "first", "best", "only" are good adjectives here)

- how long you expect all this to take
